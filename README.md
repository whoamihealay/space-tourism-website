<!-- ## My process -->

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- SSR workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What am I learning

I like a challenge ! So this time I took an Intermediate challenge to learn Next.js. Easy you might say, but no so fast. I also choose to throw Typescript in the mix. And to round things off I'll only use Styled Compoments.

Do I know any one of them? No. Will that stop me? Not even close !

### Useful resources

- [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - The docs for React are solid, I mainly used them to look up the new hooks! Reading the framework/library docs is my go-to and has never failed me! Definite recommend!
- [Next Js Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) - Same as the React Docs but for Next.Js
- [Fireship.io](https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship) - Awesome Youtube channel. Fireship.io has a "Concept/framework in 100sec" playlist to quickly learn the very basics of a Programming language, framework, or concept. There are also longer videos for more in-depth frontend mini-projects (CSS grid, flex...)
- [Brad Taversy](https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia) - Awesome Youtube Channel and Udemy course on react and the Context library. I followed his React Crash Course and Udemy course on React. His implementation of Context is what I used and I feel very comfortable with it. It has a redux feel and I love it!
- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) - Discovered on FrontendMentor with the partnership on the Space challenge and where my CSS game step up to all new level (Have a look at my other challenges to see the differences)
- [Google](google.com) - Last but not least, the ultimate bug solver!
