## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- SSR workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Javascript superset
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What am I learning

I like a challenge ! So this time I took an Intermediate challenge to learn Next.js. Easy you might say, but no so fast. I also choose to throw Typescript in the mix. And to round things off I'll use tailwind css

Do I know any one of them? No. Will that stop me? Not even close !

### How did I do ?

NextJs is fantastic! Easy to set up, even from scratch. The Next js router makes it clear that Next js is SSR orientated. The Next/Image for lazy image rendering is good for performance.

Tailwind CSS is what I needed. I thought the lengthy classnames wouldn't suit me, but I was wrong. The sole fact of not having to name anything is a big bonus. I had to tweak a few utility classes to suit my needs but, nothing too fancy and, overall the experience was great.

Typescript. You and I are going to have the best love/hate relationship. My first programming language was Java. It's a cumbersome language but, you get what you write and, if anything is wrong, it will tell you. Typescript has the same feel. When you feel lazy, it has (not) a subtle way you telling you you have to define everything single variable. Sure, vanilla JS works but does it? By the end, I felt much more confident writing code.
